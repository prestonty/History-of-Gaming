                        <p>
                            This was the game he played, it "belonged" to him.
                            Since it had a blastoise on the cartridge, he felt
                            obligated to choose squirtle. He also liked the
                            colour blue, and this established the unwritten rule
                            of always choosing the water type starter.

                            He was incapable of reading/did not try to read, so
                            he did not make it far. All of his run throughs
                            ended when he constantly failed to navigate through
                            a dark cave because he did not know the TM flash
                            existed.

                            This was the game his sibling played, it "belonged"
                            to her. Charmander was the cooler starter and this
                            later inspired him to use it on one of his play
                            throughs (but he still got stuck in the cave).

                            best friend. He even named his console "Silver" due
                            to its shiny grey exterior. When it got sick (got
                            wet in the rain during camping), he would take care
                            of it (put it in rice, heat it up in the mini
                            fridge). When he returns from chinese school on
                            Saturdays, it would be waiting for him to return so
                            he can play Pokemon Black & White.

                                Would be his favourite game if it did not stop
                                freezing. (Please let him know if you discovered
                                a way to avoid freezing). This contributed to
                                his constant saving anxiety. He would often get
                                on his knees and pray each time he threw a
                                pokemon ball. He stopped when his older cousin
                                saw him. The voltorb game later contributed to
                                his gambling addiction.

                                Trapping the sheep as pets was his natural
                                instinct. He would often recreate
                                StampyLongHead's Fun Land but since the game was
                                unable to save worlds, he kept losing his
                                progress. Like Sisphus (SEARCH UP), he continued
                                to rebuild, lose his progress, rebuild, and
                                repeat. He may not have seen this as an eternal
                                punishment as the memories he made can not be
                                forgotten.

                                This is a more darker memory. In the old days,
                                his mother would be at work, and his father
                                would be taking night school. He did not know of
                                this but would just understand that he must
                                spend his evenings at his grandfather's house.
                                During these times, he would do his homework
                                most likely from saturday school and day school.
                                One profound memory he had was trying to
                                memorize the timetable from 1 x 1 all the way to
                                12 x 12. While the caregiver would try to help
                                him out, his grandfather would get angry since
                                she would give the answers away. Back in this
                                age of development, he hated math. He also
                                disliked his grandfather and did not have a good
                                relationship with him (he could only understand
                                spoken chinese but is unable to speak it back).

                            get one for the family. Since his mother kept the
                            Apple ID password a secret, he fell in love with the
                            camera app, discovering the different filters and
                            optical illusions this new piece of technology had
