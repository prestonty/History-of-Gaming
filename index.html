                            with animals in his childhood. He was not capable of
                            reading or understanding what a pet needed so his

                        <h3 class="Game-Title">Pokemon Blue</h3>
                        <p>
                            <i>Pokemon Blue</i>, originally released as
                            <i>Pocket Monsters Blue</i> as a special edition in
                            Japan, was brought to America in 1998.
                            <br />
                            This was the game he played, it "belonged" to him.
                            Since it had a blastoise on the cartridge, he felt
                            obligated to choose squirtle. He also liked the
                            colour blue, and this established the unwritten rule
                            of always choosing the water type starter.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He was incapable of reading/did not try to read, so
                            he did not make it far. All of his run throughs
                            ended when he constantly failed to navigate through
                            a dark cave because he did not know the TM flash
                            existed.

                        <h3 class="Game-Title">Pokemon Red</h3>
                        <p>
                            The cartridge was red, it had a big dragon on the
                            front! <i>Pokemon Red</i> has one of the most iconic
                            box arts in the franchise and sold over
                            <b>31.38 million copies</b> making it the
                            franchise's best-selling video game.
                            <br />
                            This was the game his sibling played, it "belonged"
                            to her. Charmander was the cooler starter and this
                            later inspired him to use it on one of his play
                            throughs (but he still got stuck in the cave).

                            wet in the rain during camping), he would take care
                            of it (put it in rice, heat it up in the mini

                                Pokemon Diamond was by far his favourite Pokemon
                                Game. It got him into buying handbooks from
                                <i>Indigo</i> which led him down a rabbit hole
                                of collecting one for the remaining Pokemon
                                games for the DS release. He has spent the most
                                amount of time on that game. At one point, he
                                was stuck in a simulation of battling level 10
                                Bidoofs on route 201. When he regained
                                conscious, he previously level 30 Prinplup grew
                                up into a level 71 Empoleon (Not joking, the
                                overleveled starter trope was real).
                                <br />
                                He also obtained darkrai, arceus, and shaymin by
                                using the speedy bike to performing a area
                                render error and by following a youtube video,
                                he would walk in the void towards his favourite
                                legendaries in the game.

                                One of the best stories in Pokemon, Black and
                                White tells a story about more realistic
                                antagonists. Team Plasma wants to liberate
                                Pokemon and is led by a more relatable leader.

                                He felt cold towards this game because he had to
                                learn the names of 156 new Pokemon, their types,
                                and the new moves that actually do damage.

                                Pokemon White 2 is so amazing considering it is
                                a sequel to the first game. This was a risky
                                move for Pokemon, trying to resell two sequel
                                games in the same region again but it turned out
                                to be extremely successful. The developers
                                changed the towns which would have been reached
                                by post game to the starting towns. This was a
                                continuation to the previous game occurring two
                                years after the fall of team Plasma. The amount
                                of Pokemon was amazing and with this variety, he
                                decided to choose Lucario again. This game was
                                also gifted to him by his older cousin. Played
                                two run throughs, transferred his pokemon for
                                double xp shares.

                                The amount of creativity, and inspiration that
                                went into each level was remarkable. There is no
                                need for open world games when each level is
                                this replayable. The music and atmosphere
                                created by the birds chirping, the rabbits
                                hopping around the bush maze, and the
                                butterflies twirling out of the bushes creates a
                                nostalgic experience he could never forget. This
                                game was also the first video he watched from
                                Dunkey and he is proud to be a Nintendo enjoyer.
                                It actually started his love for mario and he
                                originally thought there were only 64 stars (he
                                was wrong). Definitely in the top 3 for
                                favourite DS Games.

                                would get sheer amounts of dopamine by exploring

                                how to think like an engineer, providing
                                scenarios where any solution can work. There is
                                a fire? Call a fireman or bring in a "Tamed
                                water dragon" (it did not shoot out water, it
                                was a hydra). His older sibling would not help
                                him spell the words. He also would often annoy
                                her by repeatedly asking how to spell invincible
                                so his collection of creatures would not die.

                                This was his first horror game. It was very dark
                                and isolated. This is why he only played co-op
                                with his sibling or versus battles. This was his
                                first ever first person shooter and yes, he
                                played it on the DS. The shoot button was the R
                                shoulder trigger button and it was probably one
                                of the first times he actually used it. It had
                                digital inputs for aiming but despite this, it
                                truly was a fun game.

                                He loved his chichiwawa which he named Rex. This
                                name actually originated from his older cousin's
                                dog, the same person who passed down his
                                heirloom (The Gameboy). One day, after Preston
                                and his sibling finished Saturday School at
                                Marilake Education Centre, they stayed at their
                                grandmother's house. Their cousin had to leave
                                and left a dog in their care. They wanted to
                                play with the dog so badly but their mother made
                                sure they would finish the homework they got
                                from Math and English class first (IT WAS SIX
                                PAGES PER COURSE). He had a blurry memory which
                                most certainly was a dream where he and his
                                sibling would enjoy a meal with the dog. In
                                other words they ate dog food with the dog...

                                Although Saturday school took away a few hours
                                from spending time with a real dog, he most
                                confess, Marilake was what built his exam
                                writing skills, his math skills, and showed him
                                how talented the other asian kids from different
                                cities could be. It truly picked him up from his
                                laziness and became a better student because of
                                it.

                        Trapping the sheep as pets was his natural instinct. He would

                        unable to save worlds, he kept losing his progress. Like Sisphus

                        rebuild, and repeat. He may not have seen this as an eternal
                        punishment as the memories he made can not be forgotten.

                        This is a more darker memory. In the old days, his mother would
                        be at work, and his father would be taking night school. He did
                        not know of this but would just understand that he must spend
                        his evenings at his grandfather's house. During these times, he
                        would do his homework most likely from saturday school and day
                        school. One profound memory he had was trying to memorize the
                        timetable from 1 x 1 all the way to 12 x 12. While the caregiver
                        would try to help him out, his grandfather would get angry since
                        she would give the answers away. Back in this age of
                        development, he hated math. He also disliked his grandfather and
                        did not have a good relationship with him (he could only
                        understand spoken chinese but is unable to speak it back).

                      His older cousin contributed a lot to the development, buy a brand
                      new Wii Mini for him. He still remembers when he came over with a
                      group of his friends and installed the machine onto their TV. His
                      cousin decided to play Smash Bros with him and his sibling. His
                      cousin chose Meta Knight with the white gold skin, he chose Donkey
                      Kong (because he looked the strongest), and his sibling chose
                      princess peach. His cousin destroyed them. It was one sided, the
                      PTSD still lingers to this day every time he loads in the Smash
                      Bros disk.

                        What made this game revolutionary in the series was its story
                        mode, The Subspace Emissary. It even included coop and was a
                        very untraditional way of playing the game, rather than the
                        regular free for all brawl. He found Master Hand to be a cool
                        character and the fact that Rayquaza was added to the game as a
                        boss was enough to make this his favourite game. The cutscenes
                        were some of the coolest cinematics on the Wii.

                        Looking back, this was one of the most underrated games and
                        franchises. He remembers trying to talk about it in class but
                        his friends would be confused and assume he was referring to
                        "ramen." Up to four people can play this crazy platformer where

                        gliding (botw copied), swimming, etc. The auto scrolling levels
                        where you chase the treasure box was the best parts of the game.

                        He would refund the old version and buy the new ones. This
                        introduced him to the cruel world of EB Game's trade-in program.

                        amount of calories burned in the boxing ring makes elementary
                        school recess look like a joke. Tennis was his go to game and
                        ended up losing to Matt. Bowling was usually enjoyed with his
                        friends who often came over. His lingering regret was not

                    <p>
                      On his vacation to Hong Kong in the summer of 2017, he saw
                      advertisements of the Nintendo Switch. He got his last console,
                      the 3DS, many years ago and forgot about the world of gaming, he
                      was mainly an fan of watching games.
                      <br />
                      This all changed when he visited Sham Shui Po Station. This was
                      where all the underground tech stores were located and he was
                      first attracted by the retro DS games on the display shelves. He
                      realized Nintendo was a big part of the gaming industry and was
                      making a comeback with their new Nintendo Switch. It was portable,
                      just like his DS', but had the capabilities of the Wii by having
                      the properties of a home console.
                      <br />
                      After he begged his mom, they agreed to get a discounted package:
                      A Nintendo Switch with a fancy blue case, along with 3 games -
                      Arms, Splatoon 2, and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. At
                      that night back at the hotel, he played his first third-person
                      shooter - Splatoon.
